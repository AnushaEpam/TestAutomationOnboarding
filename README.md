# **JavaScript Programs**
This repository contains the JavaScript programs as part of training onboarding process
# **JavaScript Basics **
1. Print nth multiplication table till the result is not more than desired value
    e.g. 10th table till result is not more than 102
    output format:
    1*10 =10
    2*10 =20
    3*10 =30
    4*10 =10
    5*10 =10
    6*10 =10
    7*10 =10
    8*10 =10
    9*10 =10
    10*10 =100
    it should not print 11*10 =110

2. Print first n prime numbers.
  e.g. first 25 prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
# **JavaScript Functions **
1. Write function to output Fibonacci sequence. use memoization technique
2. Write function to read, Write and append data to a text file stored in local drive.
    use fs library and use methods readfile, write file and append methods.
   
# **JavaScript Objects **
1. Implement arrow functions on below array of objects.
const employee=[
    {name:'Thomas Edwin',empid:'E111',salary:10000},
    {name:'Gregory Mathew',empid:'E555',salary:12000},
    {name:'Thomas Edison',empid:'E444',salary:8000},
    {name:'GregoryEdwin',empid:'E222',salary:6000},
    {name:'Isac Newton',empid:'E666',salary:20000},
    {name:'Thomas Gibson',empid:'E333',salary:4000}
]
Write function to return all the Objects which contain name as "Edwin"
also write function to return all the employee ids and sum of total salaries.

2. Implement add, subtract, multiply, divide and other calculation methods in "calculator" class and use them in a different class "interest calculator" 
calculate total amount to be paid after calculating the interest based on the number of months.
if number of months is less than 12, calculate simple interest at 6% and if number of months greater than 12 then calculate compound interest at 5.5%
